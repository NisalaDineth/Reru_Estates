# Enhanced Payment Processing & Monitoring Features

## New Features Implemented:

### 1. Robust Retry Mechanism
- Progressive exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s)
- Up to 5 retry attempts for payment verification
- Detailed status updates during retry process
- Error categorization to help diagnose failures

### 2. Enhanced UI Feedback
- Real-time status updates during payment verification
- Detailed error messages with troubleshooting suggestions
- Visual indicators for retry attempts
- Fallback options when verification fails

### 3. Comprehensive Monitoring System
- Automatic monitoring of "stuck" pending orders
- System recovery for orders that weren't processed
- Detailed logging of all payment events
- Integration with system_logs table for audit trails

## Using the Monitoring System

1. **Run the system logs migration**:
   ```
   node run-system-logs-migration.js
   ```

2. **Install the enhanced webhook**:
   ```
   node update-webhook-implementation.js
   ```

3. **Schedule the monitoring script** (run daily, hourly, etc.):
   ```
   node monitor-pending-orders.js
   ```

## Troubleshooting Payment Issues

1. **Check system logs**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM system_logs 
   WHERE event_type LIKE 'payment%' 
   ORDER BY event_time DESC 
   LIMIT 20;
   ```

2. **View stuck pending orders**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pending_orders 
   WHERE status = 'pending' 
   AND order_date < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 HOUR);
   ```

3. **Verify inventory changes**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM inventory_changes
   WHERE order_id = [pending_order_id];
   ```

## Maintenance Tasks

1. **Periodic cleanup of old pending orders**:
   ```sql
   UPDATE pending_orders
   SET status = 'canceled'
   WHERE status = 'pending'
   AND order_date < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 7 DAY);
   ```

2. **Monitor failed payment attempts**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM system_logs
   WHERE event_type = 'payment_intent_failed'
   AND event_time > DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 DAY);
   ```

3. **Track webhook reliability**:
   ```sql
   SELECT event_type, COUNT(*) as count
   FROM system_logs
   WHERE event_type IN ('webhook_received', 'webhook_signature_error', 'webhook_processing_error')
   AND event_time > DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 DAY)
   GROUP BY event_type;
   ```
